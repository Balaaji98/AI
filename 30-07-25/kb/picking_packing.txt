Picking & Packing Logic â€” Efficiency & Accuracy

- Pick-path optimization uses algorithms like Dijkstra or Ant Colony to minimize walking distance and reduce order picker effort by up to 40% :contentReference[oaicite:17]{index=17}.
- Batch picking: gather same SKUs together across multiple orders; cluster picking: gather several orders in one route by cart or tote for efficiency :contentReference[oaicite:18]{index=18}.
