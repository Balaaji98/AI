Exception Handling — Errors & Interrupts

- Handle receiving exceptions: damaged goods, PO mismatches, wrong item, damaged packaging — route to error queue for inspection.
- Picking exceptions: short picks, mismatches, blocked items, location issues. These become exception tasks requiring supervisor resolution.
- Overflow locations: if a zone is full, putaway automatically reroutes to overflow or buffer areas.
