Inventory Management — Cycle Counting, Blocking, Optimization

• Set cycle count frequencies based on ABC classification:  
  – A items: daily or high-frequency  
  – B/C items: weekly/monthly based on velocity [turn0search44]  
• Use pick-based triggers (e.g., count every X picks) or scheduled templates for automated execution [turn0search3]  
• Apply inventory statuses: Block expired or damaged stock as “Non‑pickable” to prevent inadvertent use [turn0search8]  
• Optimize network-level inventory using safety stock and multi-echelon modeling to reduce carrying cost by ~25 % [turn0search44]
