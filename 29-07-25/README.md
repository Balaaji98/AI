---

## 🛠️ What We Accomplished Today

### 1. 🔄 Integrated Full-Stack MVP (End-to-End)
- Combined backend (Flask), RAG logic, FAISS index, and frontend chat interface.
- Connected Groq LLaMA3-70B via Groq SDK with custom prompt loop.
- Final working version supports clarification, retrieval, and solution generation.

### 2. 🧠 RAG Pipeline Setup
- Created `wms_rag_index.py` to:
  - Load and chunk domain knowledge from `by_dispatcher_wms_knowledge.txt`.
  - Generate embeddings using `sentence-transformers`.
  - Build and save a FAISS vector index + metadata.

### 3. ⚙️ Backend (`app.py`)
- Loads FAISS index and embeddings.
- Responds to user queries with:
  - Clarifying questions if input is ambiguous.
  - Retrieved context from custom knowledge base.
- Integrated real-time response via Flask API.

### 4. 💬 Frontend (`index.html`)
- Designed a **clean, professional, mobile-friendly chat UI**.
- Supports user input/output messaging with visual polish.
- Static single page with embedded JavaScript for async fetch to backend.

### 5. 🧪 Testing Support
- Created a list of **starter prompts** to validate:
  - RAG retrieval
  - Clarification questions
  - Domain-aligned output quality

### 6. 🔍 Bug Fixes & Improvements
- Resolved file path mismatches (e.g. FAISS index file).
- Ensured compatibility across local directories and front–back sync.
- Verified FAISS reads and embedding logic end-to-end.
